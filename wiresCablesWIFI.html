    <h2>What is the infrastructure of the Internet like?</h2>
    <p>The Internet is a tangible, physical, system made to move information. It sends binary information, bits, 1 being on, 1 being off. Everything on the Internet is stored in bits, the atoms of data. Historically, binary data has been used for a long time, in morse code, and devices have been invented such as the semaphore to transfer that binary data. Bits are sent through radio waves, light, and electricity. Bits are send over a timer as well, how many 0s and how many 1s per second will determine the message.</p>
    <p>Bandwidth is the transmission capacity and is measured by bitrate, the number of bits that can be sent over a given time, usually seconds. Latency is the amount of time it takes for a single bit to travel to it's destination.</p>
    <p>Ethernet cables are used to transfer data over short distances such as within an office or a house. Fiber optic cables have mirrors on the inside of them and use light to transport data at the speed of light over long distances. WiFi utilizes radio waves to send data wirelessly.</p>
