    <h1>Encryption and Public Keys</h1>
    <p>The internet is used to transfer so much information that some of it has to be sensitive. Some examples of sensitive data is as followed:
    <ul>
    <li>Credit Card Number</li>
    <li>Social Security Number</li>
</ul>If not for encryption, which is the scrambling or changing of a message to hide it, hacking would be a cake walk. The earliest example of encryption is Caesar's Cipher, Julius Caesar would encrypt his messages so that if an enemy intercepted it, they would not gain an edge.
    </p>
    <p>Caesar's cipher was limited by there only being 26 letters of the alphabet, instead of each digit changing the same, modern encryption each digit is scrambled separately, so a 10 digit key would have 10 billion options. No human would be able to decrypt a 10 digit key but a human armed with a computer could. So, encryption keys have 256 digits today, as the digits increase the amount of possibilities increase vastly. </p>
   <p>Two types of encryption are symmetric and asymmetric. Symmetric encryption is when the same key is used by the sender and receiver, in order for this to work, the key must be agreed to in advance in private. But privacy is limited on the Internet, someone could be listening and you would have no idea. So computers use asymmetric keys, meaning there is two keys, a public and a private one. The public key is the foundation of security protocols such as SSL and TLS and is used to encrypt messages, however the private key is used to open the encrypted message.</p>
