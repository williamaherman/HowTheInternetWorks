    <h2>A collection of multiple different pieces of computer and non-computer equipment talking to one another by means of a communications network either wired or wireless.</h2>
    <p>The formal definition of the Internet is as followed: "The Internet, a loosely-organized international collaboration of autonomous, interconnected networks, supports host-to-host communication through voluntary adherence to open protocols and procedures defined by Internet Standards"<p>
    <p>As a student studying information systems, I would describe the Internet as a collection of different devices that interact with one another through a series of integrated networks.</p>
    <p>There are several types of connections, a dated example is dial-up. Today's Internet features much faster connections such as WiFi, broadband (fiber optic), and mobile. Mobile connections have evolved drastically in a short amount of time, with 5G about to be then new standard</p>
    <h2>Internet Architecture</h2>
        <p>The Internet is reached by a client using a web browser to request HTML pages from a server. The primary network examples are LANs and WANs, LANs stands for local arena network and connects computers that would be in the same room or house. WANs are used to connect LANs.<p>
        <p>WAN stands for wide arena network, so your entire street of houses each have their own LAN (assuming they have an ISP, internet service provider) and the ISP manages the WAN that consists of you and your neighbors LANs.</p>
