    <h2>What is an IP Address? How does my computer find IP addresses?</h2>
    <p>All devices have different addresses, just like each house on your block does. These are IP addresses, but instead of a street address it is just a number. IP addresses are broken down into separate parts, country, region, subnetwork, then the device itself. Each number is represented by bits, as is all information that is communicated over the Internet. IP addresses used to be 32 bits long, 8 parts each. This accounted for 4 billion unique IP addresses, which was quickly soaked up by the boom of the Internet. Currently we are transferring from IPv4 to IPv6 which will have 128 bits per address and enough IPs to give each grain of sand on Earth it's own IP address.</p>
    <p>DNS servers associates names with the IP addresses. So when you enter the URL onto your web browser, the DNS server will connect the inputted URL and it's respective IP address. There are a myriad of DNS servers, one DNS server could not possibly handle the world's traffic and they are distributed to different zones. DNS was initially created to be a public communication protocol which would be very open to hackers. </p>
